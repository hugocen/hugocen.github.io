Humans have been consuming alcohol for thousands of years, but why do we do it? While many people enjoy the taste and social aspect of drinking, there are also deeper reasons why humans are inclined to consume alcohol.

One theory is that our highly evolved brains may be the root cause of our attraction to alcohol. As humans, we have the ability to think deeply, reflect on the past, and anticipate the future. This ability can be both a blessing and a curse, as it can lead to anxiety and stress. Alcohol, in small doses, can help to reduce these feelings by decreasing activity in the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for decision making and emotional regulation.

Alcohol also releases endorphins, the feel-good chemicals in the brain, which can reduce feelings of stress and promote relaxation. This is why drinking can make people feel more relaxed and less anxious.

Another reason why humans drink alcohol is because it helps to reduce inhibitions. As humans, we have developed a sense of social etiquette, which can sometimes make it difficult to fully express ourselves. Alcohol can help to lower inhibitions, making it easier to express our true selves and interact with others.

In contrast, animals do not consume alcohol. This is because animals have different brain structures and chemical responses than humans. Alcohol is toxic to many animals, and therefore, they do not have the same attraction to it as humans do. Additionally, animals do not have the same level of cognitive processing as humans, and therefore do not experience the same level of stress and anxiety that humans do.

In conclusion, while there are many reasons why humans consume alcohol, it is likely that our highly evolved brains play a significant role. The ability to think deeply and reflect on the past and future can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress, and alcohol can help to reduce these feelings. Additionally, alcohol can help to reduce inhibitions, making it easier for humans to express themselves and interact with others. While animals do not consume alcohol due to their different brain structures and chemical responses, it is a substance that has been found useful by many human cultures over the centuries.
